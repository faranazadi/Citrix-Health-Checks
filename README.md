# Citrix Health Checks

Here is my collection of very poorly written (and unfinished in a lot of cases) scripts that I used to check the health of my on-prem Citrix environments. Emails a HTML report summarising the health of the estate. There's plenty that could have been done better here, but this was my first ever PowerShell project. Have fun with it!
